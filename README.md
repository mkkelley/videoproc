Videoproc
=========
This project is a library and application for accessing webcam information and
processing that data. The eventual goal is to reconstruct video depth and create
a 3d model of the scene from a fixed-camera perspective, but the only thing it
currently does is calculation and display of keypoint information.

Dependencies
------------
+ CMake
+ QT4
+ OpenCV2
